Notes:
- This endpoint requires authentication with a valid access token.
- Returns a list of posts from users that the current user does not follow.
- Posts are typically ordered by creation date (newest first).
- Returns an empty list if there are no posts from non-followed users.
- The structure of a Comment object within the 'comments' array would need separate documentation.
