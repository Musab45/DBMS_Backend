Implementation Details:
---------------------
- The endpoint is implemented as a custom action in the PostViewSet
- It toggles the like status (likes if not liked, unlikes if already liked)
- The like status is tracked in the likes ManyToManyField of the Post model
- The endpoint requires authentication (IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly permission)
- The response is a simple status message indicating the action taken
